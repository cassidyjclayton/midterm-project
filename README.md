# midterm-project
exactly what it sounds like XD CSC174 midterm project site

## Ontology  

## Typology  

The header and subheader typefaces were selected for their handwritten appeal, while the main body typeface  was chosen for its readability on mobile devces--sans serif typefaces tend to be easier to read on screens, making Roboto a good choice for the majority of the content. I chose Homemade Apple for the main h1 typeface because it reminded me of chalk--something quite important to climbers--and thus fit the vibe of the site, as well as the slightly feminine vibe lent to it by virtue of it being cursive. Charmoman maintained the feminine and stylized flourish, but acts as a middle ground between the visual intensity of the heavy, chalk-like Homemade Apple and the no-nonsense, business-like Roboto.

## Choreography

All the links are white--originally the icon links were not, but it felt more intuitive if they matched up with the other links so that the user could more easily intuit their purpose. The arrow cursor changes to a pointer whenever a link is hovered over as well, as a visual cure that the text (or icon) is clickable. I tried adding a tt shadow to it, but that made it feel overdoe. I perefer the simplicity and elegance of the color and cursor cue.
