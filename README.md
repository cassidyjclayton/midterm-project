## Ontology  
I chose climbing as my main topic, and then specifically honed in on profiles of female climbers--it seemed a suitably narrow subject for this project's mini-site. 

## Taxonomy  

The header and subheader typefaces were selected for their handwritten appeal, while the main body typeface  was chosen for its readability on mobile devces--sans serif typefaces tend to be easier to read on screens, making Roboto a good choice for the majority of the content. I chose Homemade Apple for the main h1 typeface because it reminded me of chalk--something quite important to climbers--and thus fit the vibe of the site, as well as the slightly feminine vibe lent to it by virtue of it being cursive. Charmoman maintained the feminine and stylized flourish, but acts as a middle ground between the visual intensity of the heavy, chalk-like Homemade Apple and the no-nonsense, business-like Roboto.
  
The second page does not follow the F-pattern; because I spoke with Professor Kostin and he approved my trial of a card layout.
I utilized the card layout because it has no inherent hierarchy, and thus suits the concept of 'profiles' really well. I left the lists as a default style intentionally because the bullet points work well for the facts about each climber.  

Regarding those bullet points, they are structured as follows: 

The CSS structure I rigged up quickly, for the CSS styles. The base level is just the basic elements, the behavior section
is where I put the styling that relies on user interaction--mostly just the a:hover. Stick-Ons are the classes and such, that
can be tacked on to other elements. 

* Age  
* Climbing Discipline  
* Also Known For/Fun Fact  
* Instagram Button and Handle  


## Choreography
The Z-pattern was implemented on the index/landing page, following the (Gutenberg?) pattern--a primary(or, as I classed it,
.lead), a strong follow, a weak follow, and a terminal. We were given two goals: to get users to read more, while the secondary
goal was to get them to sign up for an imaginary newsletter. To that end, I placed the email signup in the weak follow section,
where people tend to skim over unless they're invested, and the link to my second page in the terminal section, 
where people tend to land. In the strong follow section, I gave what amounts to the subtitle of the site as well as a link to 
follow me on instagram (that could be a third goal, I suppose, but I wanted another link and that seemed to work).  
  
To draw the user's eye through the Z, though, I made the strong and weak follow have the same text color. The lead and 
the terminal I made the same color for symmetry's sake. This demonstrates repetition. 

I relied on dark and light contrast to make the text readable and user friendly, and  kept the color palette harmonious.

All the links are white--originally the icon links were not, but it felt more intuitive if they matched up with the other links so that the user could more easily discern their purpose. This made use of the 'repetition' part of C.R.A.P. principles. The arrow cursor changes to a pointer whenever a link is hovered over as well, as a visual cue that the text (or icon) is clickable. For the small instagram icons, I felt that this was enough of a visual cue without being too obnoxious. For the navigation between the two pages, I added the unicode symbols for right and left arrows, because I felt that without it the navigation between pages was not clear enough. The "Climber Profile" navigation link is also located in the terminal section of the home page, connecting it to the next page in the site. The "Back to Main" navigation link is located in what would be the 'weak follow' section of a Z page, but a more weighty section of an F-styled page. Also, it's proximity to the "former" page (imagining it was laid out like a book whose pages you could turn) makes it a logical location. 

## Other Notes  

I really am pleased with how the card profiles turned out and the use of the instagram icons. This is possibly the project site that I am most proud of, thanks to its overall layout (and also color scheme and design).
